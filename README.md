# :robot: 3.6.0 - Understanding Capacitors

## 🤓 Overview and learning outcomes 

A capacitor stores electric charge. It's a little bit like a battery except it stores energy in a different way. It can't store as much energy, although it can charge and release its energy much faster. This is very useful and that's why you'll find capacitors used in almost every circuit board. In this activity you will practice using capacitors 🚀

## Circuit Setup

Import the file in this repository titled, "sample_circuit.txt" into the Circuit Simulator App.  You will use this circuit below on the "Next Steps" section.

## 💻 Terms to know

- Capacitance
- Farad
- Dialectric

## 📝 Next steps

1. Build the sample circuit from the file here.
2. Test it to make sure it is working (the LED is lighting up).
3. Try some different capacitors.
4. Record a video of the working circuit.
